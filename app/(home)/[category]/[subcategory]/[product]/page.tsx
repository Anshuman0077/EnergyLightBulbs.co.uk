              and lamps, as well as accessories and fittings. Owing to the quality features of energy-saving products, we are reputable for supplying high-quality bulbs at the lowest costs available online in the UK. GU10 halogen bulbs fit into GU10 bases, while most halogen lights are designed to fit into ordinary screw-in Edison bases.
              <br />
              The two-pronged, twist-and-lock method used by the GU10 light bulb base is particularly successful at keeping a bulb tight. Halogen bulbs use a tungsten filament that is quite thin and the light produces visible light by passing energy through the tungsten filament.

            <p>
              In comparison to incandescent technology, the halogen technology employed in GU10 halogen bulbs has resulted in increased efficiency.
              <br />
              Halogen lamps produce brighter light and last considerably longer. The average incandescent bulb lasted ~1,000 hours, while GU10 halogen bulbs last over 5,000 hours depending on power. The lumen output can range from 10 to 20 lumens per watt.

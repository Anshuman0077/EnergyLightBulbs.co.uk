              quality features of energy-saving products, we are reputable for
              supplying high-quality bulbs at the lowest costs available online
              in the UK. GU10 halogen bulbs fit into GU10 bases, while most
              halogen lights are designed to fit into ordinary screw-in Edison
              bases. The two-pronged, twist-and-lock method used by the GU10
              light bulb base is particularly successful at keeping a bulb
              tight. Halogen bulbs use a tungsten filament that is quite thin
              and the light produces visible light by passing energy through the
              tungsten filament. As tungsten has a greater melting point than
              any other metal, it is the most suitable metal for halogen light
              filaments. Tungsten filaments in GU10 halogen bulbs may achieve
              temperatures of above 2,550 degrees Celsius; the melting point of
              Tungsten is 3,410 degrees Celsius.

              Why Choose GU10 Halogen Bulbs?
            </h3>
            <p className="mt-[1em] mb-[1em] leading-6 text-base">
              In comparison to incandescent technology, the halogen technology
              employed in GU10 halogen bulbs has resulted in increased
              efficiency. Halogen bulbs are more efficient and last considerably
              longer than incandescent lamps because of the fill gases. Halogen
              lamps produce brighter light because the fill gases allow the
              filaments to burn at higher temperatures. In the early
              twenty-first century, the average incandescent bulb lasted around
              1,000 hours, whereas GU10 halogen bulbs were designed to endure
              for more than 5,000 hours, depending on the power. Today it is
              easy to buy halogen bulbs online with a GU10 base. The lumen
              output of halogen light bulbs can range from 10 to 20 lumens per
              watt.

      question: "Colour temperature  - What is it?",
      answers: [
        "Colour Temperate is measured in degrees using Kelvin (K), which shows the hue (colour) of a light source. Depending on the colour, temperatures range from 2700K (a warm white) to 8000K (sky white)."

      question: "Choosing a colour temperature",
      answers: [
        "The choice of temperature is dependent on the application. Nowadays we are somewhat spoiled with choice, whereas previously only warm white was available.",
        "Living rooms tend to house warm white coloured lights, due to the relaxing ambience set by the colour it gives off. These are ideal for bedrooms and dining rooms, and free from harsher whites. Natural White light is ideal for offices and more open environments and cool white light is ideally suited for areas such as the bathroom and kitchen, where mood of being clean and fresh is given off."

      question: "Meaning of “colour rendering”",
      answers: [
        "The Colour Rendering Index (CRI) is used to measure how capable a light source is of reproducing the true colour of an object, whilst being compared to a reference light source, for example sunlight.",
        "For cooler lamps, the reference light source is usually natural daylight whilst warmer lamps will use incandescent light as a reference.",
        "The lower the CRI, the more unnatural the colour will appear. The higher the CRI, the more natural they will appear. If the true colour of light is important, a higher CRI (perhaps around 90ra) is what we recommend."

      question: "Ultraviolet (UV) light production by LEDs ",
      answers: [
        "Unlike the regular fluorescent light bulbs used in your home and office, LED bulbs and tubes do not emit UV light. Fluorescent tubes do emit a small quantity of UV, but the amount produced is nowhere near the amount of UV produced by natural daylight (prolonged exposure to UV can cause skin damage)."

      question: "Comparison of heat emission of LEDs to regular halogen light bulbs ",
      answers: [
        "Incandescent and halogen bulbs, once turned on can become very hot. In comparison to LED lights, which are relatively cooler when touched. The difference occurs due to the filament being present in a halogen/incandescent bulb of which 90% of the energy created is wasted via heat, thus causing the whole bulb to become hot. LEDs do not contain a filament, thus the problem of heat doesn’t occur."

      question: "Mercury content in LEDs",
      answers: [
        "LED bulbs are a much safer technology than the older CFL (energy saving bulbs). Thus they can contain no harmful substances such as mercury."

      question: "SMD type LEDs or high power LEDs with lens mounted on the front",
      answers: [
        "If directional focused light is needed, for example, for shining on walls, pictures or tables the high power LED is suitable as it has a more focused beam of light, with a beam angle of 35 to 45 degrees.",
        "An SMD LED disperses light differently to how a high power LED disperses light. The SMD style bulbs do not have a lens to focus the light – and as a result spread the light over a greater area, typically over a 140 degree beam angle. This makes them ideal for flooding a room with light, hence reducing the amount of bulbs and saving cost.",
        "If a more focused beam of light is required, an HP LED with lens contains a typical beam angle of between 35-45 degrees. This makes them ideal for illuminating a wall, picture, table, an object or in general; an area which requires focused illumination."

      question: "Types of LEDs",
      answers: [
        "Nearly all halogen/incandescent bulbs are available in equivalent (and just as good as) LED form. The full range can be see here. Please note however, MR16 LEDs will slowly fade out as they require a transformer which will blow out. Thus, the GU10 are a more future proof LED as the fixing is mains powered."

      question: "Lifespan of LEDs",
      answers: [
        "LEDs have a huge life span of 10 years or more (around 50,000 hours of usage) and there is no need to change lamps every year. LEDs brightness also remains constant throughout its lifetime compared to incandescent/halogen/CFL lamps."

      question: "Amount of energy savings by changing to LEDs?",
      answers: [
        "In these more austere times, we understand being financially efficient is incredibly important. Investing in LED bulbs is an incredibly efficient option as you get more life from your bulbs than you would compared to halogen/incandescent bulbs.",
        "With energy prices soaring, there is no better time to move to LEDs especially with annual savings of up to 90% on your energy bills. Have a see for yourself, using our energy calculator which can be accessed here."

      question: "Environmentally friendly",
      answers: [
        " In short, yes. With older bulbs one would tend to throw them away every 6 months or so – which increases the amount of rubbish at land fill sites. Secondly, you save energy – reducing the need for the burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity, not only does this reduce your carbon footprint, but it makes the air and a cleaner."

      question: "Speed LEDs take to get to maximum brightness",
      answers: [
        "Unlike CFL bulbs, LEDs will achieve maximum brightness within milli-seconds – CFL lamps can take anywhere between 5-15 minutes to get brighter.",
        "LEDs are also safer in place we may least expect – traffic lights which use LEDs, turn off instantaneously enabling us to react to situations safer and faster."
